docs does?

    Manually : you can make logical commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is code-oriented, while projects have severals files which are linked.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to see logs and commits id, git diff is used to compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    we always can go back to previous version, and easily find the bug.
